comment: 'Adjust configuration for a 40-track Apple II drive'
is_extension: true

documentation:
<<<
This is an extension profile; adding this to the command line will configure
FluxEngine to adjust the pinout and track spacing to work with an Apple II
drive.  This only works on Greaseweazle hardware and requires a custom
connector.

For example:

```
fluxengine read apple2 --160 apple2_drive
```
>>>

usb {
    greaseweazle {
        bus_type: APPLE2
    }
}

drive {
    tracks: "c0-159h0"
    drive_type: DRIVETYPE_APPLE2
}
