comment: 'Adjust configuration for a 40-track drive'
is_extension: true

documentation:
<<<
This is an extension profile; adding this to the command line will configure
FluxEngine to read from 40-track, 48tpi 5.25" drives. You have to tell it because there is
no way to detect this automatically.

For example:

```
fluxengine read ibm --180 40track_drive
```
>>>

drive {
    tracks: "c0-40h0-1"
    drive_type: DRIVETYPE_40TRACK
}
