The Zilog MCZ is an extremely early Z80 development system, produced by
Zilog, which came out in 1976. It used twin 8-inch hard sectored floppy
drives; here's one at the <a

for Computing History</a>:

The MCZ ran Zilog's own operating system, Z80-RIO, and used 77 track
single-sided disks, with 32 sectors (each marked by an index hole), with 132
bytes per sector --- 128 bytes of user payload plus two two-byte metadata
words used to construct linked lists of sectors for storing files. These
stored 320kB each.

FluxEngine has read support for these, including support for RIO's ZDOS file
system.
