The Texas Instruments DS990 was a multiuser modular computing system from 1998,
based around the TMS-9900 processor (as used by the TI-99). It had an 8" floppy
drive module, the FD1000, which was a 77-track, 288-byte sector FM/MFM system
with 26 sectors per track. The encoding scheme was very similar to a simplified
version of the IBM scheme, but of course not compatible. A double-sided disk
would store a very satisfactory 1126kB of data; here's one at <a

FluxEngine will read and write these (but only the DSDD MFM variant).
