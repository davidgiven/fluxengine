The TI-99 was a deeply weird microcomputer from 1981, whose main claim to fame
was being built around a 16-bit TMS9900 CPU --- and also having only 256 bytes
of system RAM, with an additional 16kB of video RAM, requiring the BASIC to
store the user's program in video RAM.

It had an optional rack-mount expansion system with an optional disk drive. This
was controlled by a standard FD1771 or FD179x chip, meaning a relatively normal
IBM-scheme disk format of 35 tracks containing nine 256-byte sectors.

FluxEngine can read these.
