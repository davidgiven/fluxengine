Disk: Macintosh
===============

Macintosh disks come in two varieties: the newer 1440kB ones, which are
perfectly ordinary PC disks you should use `fluxengine read ibm` to read, and
the older 800kB disks (and 400kB for the single sides ones). They have 80
tracks and up to 12 sectors per track.

They are also completely insane.

It's not just the weird, custom GCR encoding. It's not just the utterly
bizarre additional encoding/checksum built on top of that where [every byte
is mutated according to the previous bytes in the
sector](https://www.bigmessowires.com/2011/10/02/crazy-disk-encoding-schemes/).
It's not just the odd way in which disks think they have four sides, two on
one side and two on the other, so that the track byte stores only the bottom
6 bits of the track number. It's not just the way that Macintosh sectors are
524 bytes long. No, it's the way the Macintosh drive changes speed depending
on which track it's looking at, so that each track contains a different
amount of data.

The reason for this is actually quite sensible: the tracks towards the centre
of the disk are obviously moving more slowly, so you can't pack the bits in
quite as closely (due to limitations in the magnetic media). You can use a
higher bitrate at the edge of the disk than in the middle. Many platforms,
for example the Commodore 64 1541 drive, changed bitrate this way.

But Macintosh disks used a constant bitrate and changed the speed that the
disk spun instead to achieve the same effect...

_Anyway_: FluxEngine will read them fine on conventional drives.
Because it's clever.

Reading discs
-------------

Just do:

```
fluxengine read mac <format> -o mac.dsk
```

...where `<format>` can be `--400` or `--800`.

You should end up with a `mac.dsk` file containing a raw sector image
(equivalent to `.img`).

The Mac disk format contains an extra twelve bytes of data per sector which can
be used for filesystem metadata. In practice, this was never used by anyone,
and so the default is to omit these. If you want them, specify that you want
524 byte sectors with `--layout.layoutdata.sector_size=524`. The metadata will
follow the
512 bytes of user data.

FluxEngine also supports DiskCopy 4.2 disk images, which may be a better option
if you're going to be using the image on a real Macintosh (or with other
tooling which supports it). To get one of these, use a filename like
`mac.diskcopy`. This will contain both user data and metadata.

Writing discs
-------------

Just do:

```
fluxengine write mac <format> -i mac.dsk
```

...where `<format>` can be `400` or `800`.

It'll read the image file and write it out.
