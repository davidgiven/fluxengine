## 100kB 3.5" 40-track SSSD
<!-- This file is automatically generated. Do not edit. -->

The Brother FB-100 is a serial-attached smart floppy drive used by a several
different machines for mass storage, including the Tandy Model 100 and
clones, the Husky Hunter 2, and (bizarrely) several knitting machines. It was
usually rebadged, sometimes with a cheap paper label stuck over the Brother
logo, but the most common variant appears to be the Tandy Portable Disk Drive
or TPDD:

It's a bit of an oddball: the disk encoding is FM with a very custom record
scheme: 40-track single-sided 3.5" disks storing 100kB or so each. Each track
had only _two_ sectors, each 1280 bytes, but with an additional 12 bytes of
ID data used for filesystem management.

There was also apparently a TPDD-2 which could store twice as much data, but
I don't have access to one of those disks.
