The Ampro Little Board was a very simple and cheap Z80-based computer from
1984, which ran CP/M. It was, in fact, a single PCB which you could mount
on the bottom of a 5.25" drive.

[All about the Ampro Little Board](http://oldcomputers.net/ampro-little-board.html)

It stored either 400kB on a double-sided 40-track drive or 800kB on a
double-sided 80 track drive. The disk format it used was a slightly quirky
variation of the standard MFM IBM scheme --- sector numbering starts at 17
rather than 1 (or Acorn's 0). FluxEngine supports this.

FluxEngine has direct filesystem support for these disks, or you can pass the
disk images into [cpmtools](http://www.moria.de/~michael/cpmtools/):

```
$ cpmls -f ampdsdd ampro.img

bitchk.doc
bitchk.mac
cpmmac.mac
dir.com
himem.doc
himem.mac
kaydiag.lbr
kayinfo.lbr
...etc...
```

## Options

  - Format variants:
      - `400`: 400kB 40-track DSDD
      - `800`: 800kB 80-track DSDD

## Examples

To read:

  - `fluxengine read ampro --400 -s drive:0 -o ampro.img`
  - `fluxengine read ampro --800 -s drive:0 -o ampro.img`
