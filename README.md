FluxEngine
==========

(If you're reading this on GitHub, the formatting's a bit messed up. [Try the
version on cowlark.com instead.](http://cowlark.com/fluxengine/))

**Breaking news!** As of 2024-10-01, the FluxEngine client software works
(to a point) with [Applesauce](doc/applesauce.md) hardware.

What?
-----

The FluxEngine is a very cheap USB floppy disk interface capable of reading and
writing exotic non-PC floppy disk formats. It allows you to use a conventional
PC drive to accept Amiga disks, CLV Macintosh disks, bizarre 128-sector CP/M
disks, and other weird and bizarre formats. (Although not all of these are
supported yet. I could really use samples.)

The hardware consists of a single, commodity part with a floppy drive
connector soldered onto it. No ordering custom boards, no fiddly surface
mount assembly, and no fuss: nineteen simpler solder joints and you're done.
You can make one for $15 (plus shipping).

Don't believe me? Watch the demo reel!

</div>

**New!** The FluxEngine client software now works with
[Greaseweazle](https://github.com/keirf/Greaseweazle/wiki) and
[Applesauce](https://applesaucefdc.com/) hardware. So, if you can't find a PSoC5
development kit, or don't want to use the Cypress Windows tools for programming
it, you can use one of these instead. Very nearly all FluxEngine features are
available with the Greaseweazle and it works out-of-the box; the Applesauce is a
bit less supported but still works. See the [dedicated Greaseweazle
documentation page](doc/greaseweazle.md) or the [Applesauce
page](doc/applesauce.md) for more information.

Which?
------

The current support state is as follows.

Dinosaurs (ðŸ¦–) have yet to be observed in real life --- I've written the encoder
and/or decoder based on Kryoflux (or other) dumps I've found. I don't (yet) have
real, physical disks in my hand to test the capture process, or hardware to
verify that written disks work.

Unicorns (ðŸ¦„) are completely real --- this means that I've read actual, physical
disks with these formats and/or written real, physical disks and then used them
on real hardware, and so know they work (or had reports from people who've had
it work).

If a filesystem is listed, this means that FluxEngine natively supports that
particular filesystem and can read (and sometimes write, support varies) files
directly from disks, flux files or disk images. Some formats have multiple
choices because they can store multiple types of file system.

### Notes

  - IBM PC disks are the lowest-common-denominator standard. A number of other
    systems use this format in disguise (the Atari ST, late-era Apple
    machines, Acorn). FluxEngine supports both FM and MFM disks, although you
    have to tell it which one. If you have an unknown disk, try this; you may
    get something. Then [tell me about
    it](https://github.com/davidgiven/fluxengine/issues/new).

  - Not many formats support writing yet. That's because I need actual,
    physical hardware to test with in order to verify it works, and I only
    have a limited selection. (Plus a lot of the write code needs work.)
    There hasn't been a lot of demand for this yet; if you have a pressing
    need to write weird disks, [please
    ask](https://github.com/davidgiven/fluxengine/issues/new). I haven't
    implemented write support for PC disks because they're boring and I'm lazy,
    and also because they vary so much that figuring out how to specify them
    is hard.

If you have samples of weird disks, and want to send them to me --- either
FluxEngine, Kryoflux or Catweasel dumps, or (even better) actually physically
--- I can identify them and add support.

Please note that at this point I am *not interested in copy protected disks*.
It's not out of principle. It's just they'll drive me insane. FluxEngine will
most likely be able to read the data fine, unless they're doing bizarre
things like spiral tracks or partially encoded data, but let's stick with
normal conventionally formatted disks for the time being!

But!
----

That said, I need to post a warning.

<div style="text-align: center; color: red">
<b>********** BIG DISCLAIMERY WARNING WITH ASTERISKS **********</b>
</div>

Floppy disks are old, unreliable, and frequently damaged and/or filthy. I
expect you to know what you're doing and be responsible for your own actions.
It's entirely possible for a damaged disk, when read, to scrape the magnetic
coating off the disk and pack it into the drive's disk head, not only
permanently damaging the drive, but also irrecoverably destroying any data on
the disk.

If this happens and you complain to me, I will be sympathetic but
fundamentally unhelpful. Proceed at your own risk.

Remember: **FluxEngine is not a substitute for a real data recovery
service.** Is your data worth money to you? If so, don't try to read it using
an open source project hacked together by some person you've never met on the
internet.

Also, remember to clean your disk heads.
